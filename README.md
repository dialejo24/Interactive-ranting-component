## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I reinforced my knowledge about HTML Forms. I use some CSS properties that i haven't used before like transform, animation
and set display to none and this was the first time i used javascript to build a project, fortunately everything went well.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.card {
  display: none;
  transform: rotateY(90deg);
}
```
```js
function getUserRank(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    ...
  }
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue implementing javascript on my projects. I also want to improve my CSS Skills by learning other useful
properties and i hope i can master my javascript skills too.
